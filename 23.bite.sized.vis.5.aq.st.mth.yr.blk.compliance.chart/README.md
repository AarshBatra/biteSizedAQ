Air quality is usually discussed using annual averages, city rankings,
or national maps. All of these compress time. This visual does the
opposite. It stretches 27 years of air-quality compliance into monthly
stripes, state by state, and then asks a deceptively simple question:

**Compliance with respect to which standard?**

Using the same underlying PM₂.₅ data, this post shows compliance in two
ways:

- With respect to India’s national annual PM₂.₅ standard (≤ 40 µg/m³),
  and

- With respect to the WHO PM₂.₅ guideline (5 µg/m³).

What emerges is not a disagreement about data — but a disagreement about
what we choose to call “acceptable air.”

## What the compliance stripes show

Each panel represents one Indian state or union territory.

- Columns: Years (1998–2024)

- Rows: Months (January to December)

- Colour: Percentage of subdistricts that are compliant

Compliance is always defined explicitly — either:

- 🇮🇳 with respect to the national PM₂.₅ standard, or

- 🌍 with respect to the WHO PM₂.₅ guideline

Each coloured cell answers:

> In this state, in this month, in this year — what fraction of
> subdistricts met the chosen PM₂.₅ benchmark?

The structure is identical. Only the benchmark changes.

## National standard view: a strongly seasonal problem

When compliance is measured with respect to the national PM₂.₅ standard,
a powerful and familiar pattern appears.

Across almost all states:

- July–September (monsoon months) show high compliance

- November–February (winter months) show widespread non-compliance

Visually, this appears as:

- Horizontal green bands in the monsoon

- Horizontal red bands in winter

Averaged across all states and all years:

- Monsoon months frequently show 60–100% subdistrict compliance

- January–February drop sharply, often below 40% compliance

## What this tells us

Under the national standard:

- Meteorology matters enormously

- Rain, higher boundary layers, and dispersion repeatedly push
  concentrations below 40 µg/m³

- Compliance appears to “recover” every year

From this perspective, India’s air-quality problem looks:

**Severe, seasonal, and partially reversible**

## National standard view also preserves spatial differences

Measured with respect to the national standard, states remain clearly
distinguishable.

### Mostly compliant states

Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Jammu & Kashmir,
Karnataka  
remain predominantly green across years, with only modest winter
interruptions.

### Persistently non-compliant states

NCT of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar  
show sustained red dominance, with only brief monsoon relief.

Even by the national benchmark:

- Delhi’s average compliance is extremely low

- Several large states show declining compliance coverage over time

This view supports a familiar narrative:

> Some regions are doing much worse than others, and winter is the
> critical problem.

## WHO guideline view: the seasonality collapses

Now look at the same stripes, but measure compliance with respect to the
WHO PM₂.₅ guideline.

The visual changes completely.

- Reds dominate almost every state

- Greens become rare, fragile, and localized

- Even historically “clean” states turn predominantly red

Under the WHO guideline:

- Kerala and Karnataka no longer appear clean

- Himalayan and coastal advantages weaken dramatically

- Only a few places (e.g. Lakshadweep, parts of the Northeast, Andaman
  and Nicobar Islands) show limited relief

## The most important change: seasonality largely disappears

This is the central insight.

Under the WHO guideline:

- Monsoon months no longer bring widespread compliance

- Winter is bad — but summer is also bad

- The horizontal green bands vanish

In other words:

> **The air does not become health-safe in any season for most of
> India.**

The strong seasonality seen under the national standard is not a
property of air quality alone — it is a property of the threshold.

## What this contrast really means

The national standard and WHO guideline are applied to the same
pollution data.

Yet:

- One produces a story of seasonal crisis and partial recovery

- The other produces a story of persistent, year-round non-compliance

This tells us something fundamental:

> **Seasonality in compliance is largely created by where the bar is
> set.**

The national standard sits above large parts of India’s seasonal PM₂.₅
distribution.  
The WHO guideline sits below it.

As a result:

- Monsoon months cross the national threshold

- They do not cross the WHO threshold

## How spatial differences also flatten under WHO compliance

Under the national standard:

- Delhi looks far worse than Kerala

- Punjab worse than Tamil Nadu

- Haryana worse than Odisha

Under the WHO guideline:

- Almost all states look bad

- Differences compress

- Non-compliance becomes systemic rather than regional

This does not mean pollution levels are identical everywhere. It means
that almost everywhere exceeds a health-based limit.

## What this visual does not show (by design)

These stripes represent:

- Percentage of subdistricts, not people

- Compliance coverage, not exposure or health burden

A state can appear moderately compliant while:

- A few highly polluted urban subdistricts house millions

This visual is not a burden estimate. It is a coverage diagnostic.

It answers:

> How widespread is clean air — under a given definition of “clean”?

## The core takeaway

India’s air quality problem only looks seasonal because the national
standard is permissive.

Measured against a health-based benchmark:

- Non-compliance is persistent

- Seasonal relief largely disappears

- Clean air is the exception, not the norm

Both conclusions come from the same data. The difference lies entirely
in the standard chosen.

## Why the problem still doesn’t resolve: understanding airsheds

At this point, the data has already told us something stark:

- The problem is **chronic**, not episodic

- It persists **across seasons**

- It affects **nearly all states** under a health-based benchmark

The natural next question is: **why does this persist, even when some
states try to act?**

The answer lies in something we rarely design policy around:
**airsheds**.

An *airshed* is the atmospheric equivalent of a river basin. Just as
water flows downhill across districts and states, **air moves across
large, connected regions shaped by geography, wind patterns, and
topography**.

A river basin is visible but an airshed isn’t, but this intangibleness
of the airsheds leads to a natural ignorance of its importance. This
ignorance is very dangerous. Having an airshed based approach to tackle
air pollution is non-negotiable if we want to make a dent in this
problem.

Within an airshed:

- Pollution emitted in one place does not stay local

- Emissions mix, accumulate, and travel

- Downwind regions inherit upwind decisions

State borders do not interrupt this flow. Mountains, plains, coastlines,
and prevailing winds do.

## The Racing Pollution Charts and What They Reveal

The racing charts below animate **population-weighted annual PM₂.₅
concentrations (1998–2024)** across states.

The data is identical in both views. Only the grouping changes.

### When states are coloured by geographic regions

![](images/pollution_race_geographic_regions.gif)

Using North, South, East, West, and Northeast:

- Pollution appears fragmented

- States within the same region move differently

- The problem looks like a collection of local failures

This mirrors how air quality is usually discussed and governed.

### When states are coloured by airsheds

![](images/pollution_race_airsheds.gif)

Recolour the same chart by airsheds, and structure appears immediately.

- **Indo-Gangetic Plain states move together**, forming a single,
  persistent pollution basin

- **Peninsular India clusters lower**, benefiting from maritime
  ventilation

- **Central-East India acts as a dusty, industrial corridor**, linking
  multiple regions

- **Mountain–Northeast states behave as semi-isolated systems**, shaped
  by valleys and local circulation

This is not coincidence. It is atmospheric physics.

## Why airsheds help paint a more comprehensive story

The WHO comparison tells us **how bad the problem is**. Airsheds explain
**why it refuses to go away**.

Large parts of India are not failing independently. They are failing as
**connected atmospheric systems**.

Local, city-level, or even state-level actions operate *inside* these
systems. Their impact is therefore limited unless the entire airshed
changes.

This is why:

- Improvements plateau

- Winter action plans struggle

- Compliance rarely shifts under health-based benchmarks

## Conclusion: the mismatch at the heart of India’s air crisis

Put all the pieces together:

- **The national standard makes the problem look seasonal**

- **The WHO guideline reveals it as chronic**

- **Airsheds show why isolated fixes cannot succeed**

India’s air quality crisis is not:

- Just a winter problem

- Just a Delhi problem

- Just a state-wise problem

It is a **persistent, transboundary, atmospheric problem** being managed
with tools designed for administrative convenience, not physical
reality.

As long as we:

- Judge success using permissive thresholds

- Design policy within political borders

- Treat pollution as episodic rather than structural

We will keep mistaking movement for progress.

Clean air will appear and disappear on charts — while exposure remains.

The data is already telling us what to do.

We need to stop managing maps, and start managing the atmosphere.

## Takeaways: A Shared Responsibility

Air pollution knows no borders. While the burden of action falls heavily
on governments and funders, each of us has a very important role to play
in advocating for cleaner air. Whether it’s supporting organizations,
raising awareness in your community, or calling on leaders to prioritize
air quality, the time to act is now.

Clean air should not be a luxury; it’s a human right. Let’s ensure that
every breath we take moves us closer to a world where that right is
realized for all.
