# biteSizedAQ

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Background

The Air pollution problem can seem like a mammoth. The objective of this
project is to make AQ more accessible and open to everyone. The
‘biteSized’ part of ‘biteSizedAQ’ is there to remind us to not get
overwhelmed by the size of the air pollution problem, the mammpth can be
tackled with smart steps. Take enough bite sized smart steps and soon we
can put a leash on the mammoth.

As and when I can, I’ll continue to add more projects under this repo.
To start off, check out the first project: Using satellite derived air
pollution and population data, combined with India block (subdistrict)
level shapefile, I have created a block level air pollution dataset. See
below to learn more.

## General structure of projects in this repo

- Each individual project correspond to it’s own Rmd file, which can be
  found at the root of the repo.

- A project folder of the same name as the Rmd also exists at the root
  of the repo.

- The number prefix at the start of every project folder/Rmd name is the
  project number under this repo.

- The latest project will show up top.

## Project 1: Block level satellite derived population weighted air pollution dataset for India from 1998-2022
