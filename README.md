## Background

Air pollution can feel like a giant, overwhelming issue, but the goal of
this project is to make air quality (AQ) information accessible and
understandable for everyone. The name ‘biteSizedAQ’ serves as a reminder
that even the largest problems can be tackled with small, manageable
steps. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, we can break down the air
pollution challenge into smaller tasks, taking each one step at a time.
By consistently taking these bite-sized, smart steps, we can
collectively make significant progress in managing air pollution.

All projects under this repository are free and open, provided under the
CC BY 4.0 International License. This ensures that anyone can use,
share, and build upon the work, making air quality information more open
and accessible for all.

This repository will continue to grow with new projects as and when I
find time. To kick things off, check out the first few projects below!

## General structure and how to navigate projects in this repo

- The number prefix at the start of every project folder/Rmd name is the
  project id under this repo.

- The latest project will show up top.

- E.g. Project 1 has the id 1. It corresponds to a project folder named
  `1.ind.block.pm2.5.sat.data.processing` which contains the project’s
  README file. In case of a project involving code and data an
  additional Rmd containing code can be found at the root of the
  biteSizedAQ repo.

- The corresponding helper R script(s) for different projects can be
  found under `R/` subfolder. These scripts will be grouped in broad
  themes. E.g. all satellited derived data processing functions will be
  in the sat data helper script and the names are descriptive enough for
  it to be easily identifiable.
